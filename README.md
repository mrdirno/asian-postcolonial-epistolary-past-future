### Story Entry Points

- Write a letter from a future descendant, responding to a secret found in Zixin's archive.
- Create a monologue from Old Man Fai's perspective, detailing the other 'ghosts' he has delivered.
- Draft a 'consensus narrative' entry from the state archives about the Collapse, then write the marginalia Zixin would add to it.
- Describe a memory that returns to Zixin's mother as the 'chosen forgetting' begins to crack.

### Technical Entry Points

- Design a speculative interface for Zixin's 'forensic palimpsest' software, visualizing corrupted data-streams as a physical landscape.
- Prototype a tactile codex: a book where the raised, interlocking script of the second letter can be felt, triggering different audio fragments of the story.
